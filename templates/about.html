                As a web developer with a passion for crafting functional and visually appealing websites, I set out to create a simple and user-friendly to-do list app that would stand out from the overwhelming and confusing options available in the market. My frustration with existing solutions fueled my desire to build something unique, and I believe that Memento is the perfect embodiment of my vision. <br><br>Crafted with Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Figma, Memento is a to-do list web app designed to cater to the needs of busy individuals, small businesses, and anyone looking to streamline their task management. I put in a lot of thought and effort into the design process, ensuring that the end product was not only functional but also had a modern and stylish look that users would find appealing. <br><br>I believe that small businesses and independent users should have access to quality websites, and I am thrilled to bring my skills and creativity to the table with Memento. I am confident that users will find the app easy to use, and I hope that it will become an indispensable tool for anyone looking to manage their tasks and increase their productivity. <br><br>I am proud of the work that I have put into Memento, and I am eager to see how it will be received by the public. Whether you are an individual looking to simplify your task management or a small business owner in need of a functional and visually appealing to-do list app, Memento is the perfect solution for you.
